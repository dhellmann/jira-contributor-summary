In this directory create a new python program to review a hierarchy of jira
tickets to summarize who is contributing to each one.

Start with tickets of type Feature, Issue, and Bug, then collect the information
for the children of each ticket, recursively.

Determine contributors for a ticket by looking at the assignee, additional
assignees, and contributors fields of a ticket.

Produce as output a nicely styled static HTML file showing the tickets from the
top of the hierarchy to the bottom, sorted by the Rank for each ticket, in
ascending order. Show the ticket ID as a link to the jira page showing the
ticket details. Show the title of the ticket. Then show a comma separated list
of the unique full names of the contributors for the ticket and any descendant
tickets.

Save ticket details in a cache so that it is only necessary to download data for
tickets edited since the last time the program ran. Save the cache to a
directory specified by the user. Default to a location returned by the appdirs
package.

Save the output HTML file to a specified path, defaulting to
jira-contributor-summary.html.

Organize the code to make it easy to package with hatchling.

Configure hatch to run ruff as a linter and to run the unit tests with pytest.

Use click to process command line arguments.

Add command line options to specify the jira instance and jira project.

Use the environment variable JIRA_TOKEN to access the jira API bearer token.
